## Milestones

- 0-15%: Foundations speed (`projects/01-cluster-foundations-and-speed.md`)
- 16-30%: Workloads + storage (`projects/02-workloads-scheduling-storage.md`)
- 31-45%: Services + NetworkPolicy + DNS (`projects/03-services-networkpolicy-dns.md`)
- 46-60%: Gateway API migration (`projects/04-gateway-api-migration.md`)
- 61-70%: Helm operations (`projects/05-helm-release-operations.md`)

- 89-95%: Troubleshooting bootcamp (`projects/08-troubleshooting-bootcamp.md`)
- 96-100%: Timed mocks (`exam/mock-exam-blueprint.md`)

## Backtrack Policy

- If a bug drill fails twice, auto-recommend previous project review.
- If timebox overruns by >50%, suggest one focused speed drill.
- If mock score <66%, rewind to weakest weighted domain.
