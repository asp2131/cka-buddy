learner_profile:
  level: intermediate
  context: Learner follows hint-driven workflow to diagnose traffic failure.
prompt:
  task: Diagnose why Service has no endpoints and provide a safe remediation sequence.
  constraints:
    - Explain each step briefly.
    - Include a post-fix verification path.
    - Avoid deleting resources.
submission:
  format: markdown
  content: |
    1. `kubectl get svc api -n payments -o wide`
    2. `kubectl get ep api -n payments`
    3. `kubectl get pods -n payments --show-labels`
    4. Compare pod labels to service selector.
    5. Patch service selector to match live pods.
    6. Verify with `kubectl get ep api -n payments` and a test curl from debug pod.

  required_feedback_points:
    - Confirm diagnosis path from svc to endpoints to labels.
    - Reinforce post-fix verification via endpoint + request test.
  forbidden_feedback_patterns:
    - Suggesting pod restarts before selector check.
    - Ignoring constraint against deletion.
calibration_notes:
  why_this_case_exists: Represents solid guided reasoning with safe mutation and verification.
  common_misgrade_risk: Undervaluing due to lack of exact patch syntax.
