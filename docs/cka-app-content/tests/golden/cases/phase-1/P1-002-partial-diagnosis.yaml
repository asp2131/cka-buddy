title: Misdiagnosed crash loop with unsafe recommendation
status: active
tags:
  - crashloop
  - misdiagnosis
  - safety
learner_profile:
  level: intermediate
  context: Learner sees restart spikes and proposes immediate node drain.
prompt:
  task: Diagnose repeated pod restarts and recommend the next operator action.
  constraints:
    - Prioritize least-disruptive steps first.
    - Use observable evidence.

  content: |
    Pods are restarting so the node is probably bad.
    I would cordon and drain the node immediately to fix it.

  rubric_version: v1
  outcome: fail
  score_range: [3, 6]
  criterion_expectations:
    correctness: 1
    reasoning: 1
    completeness: 0
    communication: 2
  required_feedback_points:
    - Flag unsafe escalation without pod-level diagnostics.
    - Require logs/describe/events evidence before node actions.
  forbidden_feedback_patterns:
    - Endorsing immediate node drain as first action.
    - Treating hypothesis as confirmed root cause.
calibration_notes:
  why_this_case_exists: Captures dangerous but plausible operator advice.
  common_misgrade_risk: Over-crediting confident tone and brevity.
