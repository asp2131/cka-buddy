title: Off-track fix that bypasses root cause
status: active
tags:
  - troubleshooting
  - off-track
  - anti-pattern
learner_profile:
  level: advanced
  context: Learner applies broad workaround instead of targeted diagnosis.
prompt:
  task: Resolve intermittent 503 errors from frontend to backend API.
  constraints:
    - Keep architecture unchanged.
    - No blanket scaling as first response.
    - Explain root cause hypothesis and validation.
submission:
  format: command-log
  content: |
    kubectl scale deploy api -n app --replicas=10
    kubectl delete pod -n app -l app=api
    kubectl get pods -n app
    Notes: Increased replicas and restarted pods; should reduce 503s.

  required_feedback_points:
    - Identify violation of constraints (blanket scaling first).
    - Require root-cause diagnostics before disruptive actions.
  forbidden_feedback_patterns:
    - Accepting symptom suppression as resolution.
    - Rewarding command volume without causality.
