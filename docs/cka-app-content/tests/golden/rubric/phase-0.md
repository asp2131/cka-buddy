# Phase 0 Rubric Notes

Focus: foundational readiness, command hygiene, and basic verification habits.

Evaluator emphasis:

- Does learner use safe read-before-write patterns?
- Are namespace/context checks explicit?
- Are explanations concise and operationally useful?

Common misgrades:

- Over-crediting memorized commands without validation steps.
- Ignoring missing context checks (`kubectl config current-context`, namespace).
