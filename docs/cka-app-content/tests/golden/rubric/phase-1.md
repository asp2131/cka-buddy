# Phase 1 Rubric Notes

Focus: guided remediation with constrained decision-making.

Evaluator emphasis:

- Is the learner following constraints while still making progress?
- Are intermediate checks included before escalation?
- Is reasoning tied to observable evidence?

Common misgrades:

- Awarding high reasoning when diagnosis is asserted but not evidenced.
- Under-penalizing omission of rollback/safety notes in mutable operations.
