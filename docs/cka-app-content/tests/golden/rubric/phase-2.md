# Phase 2 Rubric Notes

Focus: independent troubleshooting, synthesis, and robust operator communication.

Evaluator emphasis:

- Does learner prioritize likely root causes efficiently?
- Are fixes validated end-to-end (service, pod, and user-facing checks)?
- Is the final recommendation production-safe and auditable?

Common misgrades:

- Over-crediting command volume without coherent strategy.
- Missing severe penalties for unsafe or irrelevant changes.
