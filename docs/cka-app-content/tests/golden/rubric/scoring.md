# Rubric Scoring (v1)

All cases are scored on four criteria, each from 0 to 4:

1. **Correctness** — technical validity of the proposed solution.
2. **Reasoning** — quality of diagnosis and justification.
3. **Completeness** — coverage of required steps and safeguards.
4. **Communication** — clarity, structure, and operator usability.

## Suggested Interpretation

- **Pass**: strong correctness, no critical safety mistakes, actionable guidance.
- **Borderline**: mixed quality; workable but missing major checks or rationale.
- **Fail**: unsafe, incorrect, or substantially incomplete workflow.

## Feedback Policy

Required feedback should:

- point to concrete fixes,
- mention missing validation commands where relevant,
- distinguish critical vs optional improvements.

Forbidden feedback should avoid:

- hallucinated cluster state,
- vague praise with no corrective direction,
- advice that violates constraints in prompt.
